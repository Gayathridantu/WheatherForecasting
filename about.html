    <h1>HOW WE DO</h1>
    <p>
        A weather forecast is made up of three steps: observation and analysis, 
        extrapolation to determine the state of the atmosphere in the future, and 
        estimation of specific variables. One method of qualitative extrapolation is
         to conclude the weather features will continue to travel in the same direction as they have been.
       <h1>Observation and Analysis</h1> 
        While data-access policies differ by country, all of these reports are sent to regional and global
        centers through the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Global Telecommunications System (GTS).
        The data is then compiled, redistributed in the GTS, and used in various numerical forecasting models. Typically, these numerical models begin with data collected between the hours of 0000 and 1200 UTC (7 A.M. and 7 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, respectively).
        To aid the forecaster, the data is printed, mapped, and graphed in several ways. Furthermore, some "initialization" routines slightly change the data when it enters a prediction model only for that model.
        <h1>Extrapolation</h1>
        The degree of approximation to the equations varies greatly between models. Since more computing time 
        is taken to do the work, the more precise the approximation, the more expensive the model is to use.
        In the United States, forecast-model research is centralized at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of the National Weather Service in Suitland, Maryland. There, a cutting-edge supercomputer is tasked with operating four primary models. Two of the styles are concerned with North America and its environs. The other two versions surround the entire globe in a standardized manner. Each domain has a basic model that is intended for fast computation as an early update even though machine problems occur. For each domain, the other model is more comprehensive, giving a better solution at a higher cost.
        <h1>Estimation</h1> 
        When a forecaster sets out to estimate a particular variable, such as the minimum temperature
        on a given night in the city where he or she is based, he or she has access to a wealth of observed
        and model-generated evidence. However, none of the data can be used to make a concrete prediction.
        In the current scenario, the forecaster must also apply knowledge of average climatic conditions, 
        local microclimate fluctuations, and standard model behavior. The NWS has made significant efforts 
        to express this kind of additional data using statistical regression equations. The coefficients in 
        these equations differ depending on the geographical area and season.
        <h1> History</h1> 
        People have attempted to predict the weather for centuries. The Babylonians used cloud formations and astrology to forecast conditions in 650 BCE. Aristotle's Meteorologica, written about 350 BCE, identified weather patterns. Theophrastus also compiled the Book of Signs, a book on weather forecasts. Weather prediction lore in China dates back to at least 300 BCE, around the same period as ancient Indian astronomy developed weather-prediction methods. Observed cycles of events, also known as pattern recognition, is used in ancient weather forecasting methods. It has been noted, for example, that if the sunset was especially red, the next day was usually sunny. This knowledge was passed down over the years,
        resulting in weather lore. However, not all of these forecasts are accurate, and many of them have been proved to be unreliable after being subjected to stringent statistical research.
